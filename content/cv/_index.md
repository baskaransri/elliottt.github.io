Over a decade of experience applying functional programming to hard problems:
program analysis, cyber-security, and language design.

# Work Experience

## Stripe - April 2019 - Present
**Infrastructure Engineer** - Working on the [sorbet] typechecker for ruby.

## groq, inc. Sept 2017 - March 2019
**Compiler Engineer** - Working on a compiler for tensorflow models,
targeting a custom ASIC that accelerates inference. Focusing on compiler
performance and optimization of results.

## Galois, Inc. - Sept 2007 - Sept 2017
**Member of the technical staff** - Contributed to a broad range of projects,
notably:
* Developed domain specific languages in Haskell, including the
  [msf-haskell] metasploit DSL and the [ivory] DSL for memory-safe
  embedded programming
* Developed and contributed to multiple full language implementations,
  including [cryptol] and the [salty] GR(1) reactive synthesis DSL
* Implemented the [hans] network stack
* Aided ASIC design and verification for lightweight cryptographic
  primitives from Cryptol specifications

## CollegeNET, July 2004 - September 2007
**Developer** - Helped to transition a large desktop application to a suite of
web services, and developed tools based off of those web services. Also
assisted with some front-end web development, and implemented an LDAP-based
authentication system.

## CollegeNET, July 2002 - July 2004
**Technical Support** - Provided technical support to a large client base.

# Publications

## September 2016

### TrackOS: A security-aware real-time operating system, RV.
Introduces the TrackOS embedded operating system. TrackOS allows for run-time
monitoring of control flow for running tasks, with a control flow graph that is
established during a post-processing pass that doesn't require access to source
code.

## August 2015

### Guilt Free Ivory, Haskell Symposium
Describes the implementation of the Ivory domain specific language in Haskell,
as well as the static guarantees that the language provides.

## December 2014

### Multi-App Security Analysis with FUSE: Statically Detecting Android App Collusion, PPREW
Introduces the FUSE system, which is used to detect collusion between android
apps installed on the same phone.

## November 2014

### Programming Languages for High-Assurance Autonomous Vehicles, PLPV
Introduces domain specific languages as a means for programmer productivity, in
the realm of programming for autonomous vehicles.

## August 2014

### Building Embedded Systems with Embedded DSLs, ICFP
An experience report detailing the development of the [smaccmpilot] autopilot in
the Ivory and Tower Haskell EDSLs. At the time, [smaccmpilot] comprised 10K
lines of haskell, and generated about 50K lines of C.

## September 2010

### Concurrent Orchestration in Haskell, Haskell Sympmosium
Describes the embedding of the [orc] orchestration language as the [haskell orc]
library.
